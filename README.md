I'm Brazilian, living in Portugal since 2021.
My first experience with programming beginned in October of 2022.
I start this studies self-taught, starting with some YouTube tutorials, and later some free courses.
My favorite is https://balta.io , because have great and free courses of C# and more things.
Maybe I will pay for Premium to learn more, if I need learn more.

Well, in this last 2 weeks of October I learned somethings in the programming:
- Programming logic;
- How to use VisualStudio and VS Code;
- Make queries in SQL (using Microsoft SQL Server);
- Create a little game to divination in Python, where I will do a project to continue this development to apply new knowledges and create more resources;
- Use Git and GitHub to control versions of the code;
- And until the end of the month I will create more 2 little programs in C#.

I will up this files here then I finish it.


But it's not all.
I learned English just listen to musics, reading translations, some movies...
This last month I begin to talk with peoples using Omegle and another tools to practice my English.
Well, I loved this experience.
Some Americans, Australians, Indians and Russians belaud me, and it's make me more proud about my decision and my willpower to learn and grow

I believe what I can do a great work in the world of Security of Information, because I always read and have interest in this area.
Security and privacy are essential nowadays, where our lifes stay in our hands with a smartphone or our jobs doned in a computer.

Ok, it's not a blog, but if you are reading this, you can understand a little about what I'm doing and thinking about this new project of my life.
Specially if you are from a company of security in Lithuania 👀
